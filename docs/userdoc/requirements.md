# Use PICS app

To work properly with pics you need a few requirements.

## Pictures requirements

PICS actually suports only importing `.jpg` pictures format. If you have `.png` photos or other formats, it will be ignored by the application.

PICS uses a predefined folder structure. For photos to be properly imported, you need to respect the following folder structure :

* Main folder (this folder will contain all your pictures library)
  * Subfolder (this folder will contains the pictures for one event you makes pictures)
    * Picture 1
    * Picture 2
    * Pucture 3
    * ...
  * Subfolder (another event)
    * Picture 1
    * Picture 2
    * ...
  * ...

Here an example of Pics library

* MyPictures
  * Italy
    * Pics 1
    * Pics 2
    * Pics 3
  * Zermatt
    * Pics 1
    * Pics 2
  * Munich
    * Pics 1
    * Pics 2

Of course, you can note the sub folders as you want, not necessarily by places.
